# Bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

BookBot is a command-line text analysis tool that processes book files and provides insightful statistics about their contents.

## Features
- Word count analysis
- Character frequency counting
- Sorted reporting of character usage
- Command-line interface that accepts any text file path

## Usage (macOS)

```bash
python3 main.py <path_to_book>
```

## Example

```bash
python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt
```

Note that you will need to have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system in order to be able to run the program.

You can find free eBooks to download and test here: [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
